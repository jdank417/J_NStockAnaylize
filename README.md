This is a stock anyalization tool that is being built with the capacity for growth into a stock prediction tool with weekly and daily updates on the market.




Developmental ideas:
Risk method (is this stock a risky investment, create some sort of scale)
Develop trendline for roi which acts dynamically depending on the dates entered
Create chart to display essential data (price, roi, etc)
Efficiency ratio (expenses / revenue) if less than 50% considered efficient (secondary to comparing to major benchmark which is widely accepted to be S&P) (this is to determine a company's efficiency, is this company in “the green”)
Think about a way to automate the display of roi (create a graph where users can select a timeframe such as 1 year and display data for that year) (some sort of historical performance mechanism)
Dividend Yield = Dividend per share / Market value per share
Adjusted Volume 
Find dividend somewhere in data API offers and apply this formula 
P/E ratio is price per share / earnings per share (this is for the company, similar to efficiency ratio)
Owners earnings search key
